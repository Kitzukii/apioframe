# This project is now not used anymore. Please check apioframe-cores for newer info, I will not be taking any PRs on this code, you are free to complain about my shit in the RCC discord. https://reconnected.cc/ for said discord.

so, this is the apioframe turtle stuff.

probably going to be replaced by something better, but since qrmcat wont work on anything apioframe related, other than the reactor...

im the only one on this project. currently, atleast.

## install
`wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kitzukii/apioframe/refs/heads/main/agents/install.lua`
