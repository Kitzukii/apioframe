so, this is the apioframe turtle stuff.

probably going to be replaced by something better, but since qrmcat wont work on anything apioframe related, other than the reactor...

im the only one on this project. currently, atleast.

## install
`wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kitzukii/apioframe/refs/heads/main/agents/install.lua`
